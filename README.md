This project represents the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The primary objective was to gather, clean, and preprocess data pertinent to the success or failure 
of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings. Subsequently, we employed Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and 
KNN methods to forecast the outcome of these landings.

Initially, data was sourced from an API and supplemented through web scraping of a relevant Wikipedia page.

In the subsequent phase, we engaged in Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Utilizing visualization 
tools and SQL, we delved into the dataset. Furthermore, we leveraged Folium to construct an interactive map and developed a 
Dashboard using Plotly Dash to offer valuable insights.

Finally, we constructed predictive models and evaluated their efficacy. Given the classification nature of the project, 
we utilized a confusion matrix to draw conclusions.
